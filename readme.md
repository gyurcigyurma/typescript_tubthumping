### How this repo works? ###

Only src/app.ts is compiled to *compiled* folder and *index.html* uses it. If you want to study any file from *src* folder, just copy its content to app.ts.

Then simply run __*tsc*__  or __*tsc --watch*__. With __*npm start*__ you can run a server for auto reload the page.
